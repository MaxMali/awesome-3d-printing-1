### Libraries and Tools

#### Toolpath - Generator

- [CuraEngine](https://github.com/Ultimaker/CuraEngine) - A powerful, fast and robust engine for processing 3D models into 3D printing instructions, written in C++
- [MatterSlice](https://github.com/MatterHackers/MatterSlice) - a C# console application that generates GCode (hardware control) for 3D printing. It was originally ported from CuraEngine (another great open source 3D printing engine). It is the primary slicing engine for MatterSlice and under constant development.
- [opencamlib](https://github.com/aewallin/opencamlib) - open source computer aided manufacturing algorithms library, written in C++
- [PyCAM](http://pycam.sourceforge.net/) - a toolpath generator for 3-axis CNC machining. It loads 3D models in STL format or 2D contour models from DXF or SVG files. The resulting G-Code can be used with LinuxCNC or any other machine controller. Written in Python
- [CamMill](https://github.com/cammill/cammill) - CAM application to produce tool paths and gcode from DXF files, written in C

#### Toolpath - Interpreter

- [GHermeneus](https://github.com/Ultimaker/GHermeneus) - a fast GCode interpreter and parser, written in C++20
- [gcode3d](https://github.com/patrickelectric/Gcode3D) - GCode visualizer
- [yagv](https://github.com/jonathanwin/yagv) - A fast 3D Gcode Viewer for Reprap-style 3D printers, in Python and OpenGL

#### Toolpath - Misc

- [Universal-G-Code-sender](https://github.com/winder/Universal-G-Code-Sender) - A Java based GRBL compatible cross-platform G-Code sender.
- [RepRaptor](https://github.com/NeoTheFox/RepRaptor) - A Qt RepRap gcode sender/host controller
- [Pronterface](https://github.com/kliment/Printrun) - Pronterface, Pronsole, and Printcore - Pure Python 3d printing host software
- [3delta](https://github.com/minad/3delta) - 3Î” is a host software for 3d printers of the delta style. In many aspects it is similar to Pronterface. However it brings additional motion control better suited to non-cartesian delta printers.

#### Toolpath - PostProcessing
